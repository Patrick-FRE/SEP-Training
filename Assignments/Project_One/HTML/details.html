                    I have done Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Dayton.
                    I have undergone courses in <i>Machine Learning</i> with <b>Python</b> and <i>Computer Vision</i>
                    in Matlab. I am passionate towards learning <i>Full-Stack technologies</i> and I have
                    learned JavaScript, NodeJS, MongoDB and currently learning ReactJS.

                    <hr class="hr">
                    I did my undergrad in Computer Science & Engieering at Vignan's Institute of Information
                    and Technology in India. I have gained enough knowledge on Computer Science and its
                    related technologies. My area of interest lied in <i>Database Management Systems</i> and my
                    prefered language is <b>Java</b>. My interests aligned towards data security and I have done
                    final project in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>,
                    which is encrypting and decrypting data.
                    <p class="boxed">
                        I have also participated in several workshops inclusing
                        <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html">CCNA</a>
                        (Cisco Certified Network Associate), which is an exceptional course for learning networking
                        algorithms and designing networks using LAN, WAN, MAN.<br/>
                        Having keen interest in data security, I leaned towards learning ethical hacking
                        in Kali Linux.

                        Apart from my curricular details, I love to play badminton and I along with a team
                        conducted a badminton tournament at my college and I also participated in several other
                        activities that involve team coordination.
