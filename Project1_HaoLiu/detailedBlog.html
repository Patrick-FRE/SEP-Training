                <h1>James Harden was Traded to Nets</h1>
                <h6>Jan 2021 by <a href="#">HaoLiu</a></h6>
                <p class='p1'>League sources told ESPN's <a href="#">Adrian Wojnarowski</a> and Ramona Shelburne that the Rockets will trade LeVert to the Indiana Pacers for Victor Oladipo. The Rockets and Pacers have not yet announced that deal.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="p2">Houston also receives three unprotected first-round picks from Brooklyn -- in 2022, 2024 and 2026 -- plus pick swaps in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027, the Nets announced. The Rockets also get Cleveland's 2022 first-round pick, via the <a href="#">Milwaukee Bucks</a> , and Houston is sending a 2023 second-round pick to the Pacers, sources told ESPN. </p>
                <div class="p3">
                    <p>Brooklyn also gets a 2024 second-round pick from the Cavaliers. The Nets have three open roster spots to fill out their bench, if they choose -- a $5.7 million tax midlevel, the minimum exception and likely a $5.7 million disabled player exception.</p>

                    <h1>Greek Freak</h1>
                    <p>Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, the league's two-time reigning MVP, said the trade is "an amazing move by Brooklyn."</p>

                    <p class="p4">Harden hired Jason Ranne and Chafie Fields from Wasserman, and they worked closely with the Rockets and all teams involved to secure the trade for him, sources told ESPN. Wasserman also represented Russell Westbrook and worked closely with the Rockets on his trade to Wizards.</p>
                    <h2>Sub-Heading</h2>
                    <p>"On behalf of the entire Rockets organization and the City of Houston, I'd like to thank James Harden for an amazing eight-plus seasons in a Rockets uniform," Rockets owner Tilman J. Fertitta said in a statement. "James has provided us with so many great memories as we've watched him grow from Sixth Man of the Year to a perennial All-Star and MVP. My family and I also want to thank James for his many off the court contributions, including generous charitable donations and multiple annual community events. We wish James the best of luck and will always be grateful for the memories."</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>James Harden</li>
                        <li>Kevin Durant</li>
                        <li>Kyrie Irving</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By adding Harden, the Nets will be able to trot out a lineup of three players capable of scoring 25 or more points on any night, giving them a collection of firepower to rival any big three in recent years.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Carmelo Anthony</li>
                        <li>Lebron James</li>
                        <li>Chris Paul</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Durant, who scored 26 points in the Nets' 116-109 win over the Knicks on Wednesday, is averaging 29.4 points through nine games in his first season back from surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon. Irving was scoring 27.1 per game before leaving the team last week for personal reasons.</p>
