### CSS

- css reset vs css normalize
  
- user agent stylesheet - defined by browser 
  
- `box-sizing: border-box` defines how the width and height of an element are  calculated: should they include padding and borders, or not.

- universal selector `*` does not include `::before` and `::after`
  
- Layout: flexbox(one-dimension),  css-grid(two-dimension) and float(not meant for layout), but we can use flexbox with wrap for some two-dimension layouts

    - why we use IIFE: encapsulation, don't affect global object
