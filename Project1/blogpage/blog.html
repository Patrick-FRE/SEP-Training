                iPhone 12 Review
              </h2>
              <p><small class="text-mute">Oct 20, 2020 by David Phelan and Corbes Personal Shopper</small></p>
              <p>This blog post shows a few different types of content that's supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, images, and code are all supported.</p>
              <p>
                The new iPhone 12 is here. The hero phone in the iPhone 12 series comes with new features, improved design, a faster processor and a significantly tougher screen (hooray!). Oh, and this is the first 5G iPhone, as you may have heard.
                For this iPhone 12 review, I have been using the latest Apple handset since shortly after it was revealed on October 13, putting it through its paces and testing the performance, battery life, camera and whether the design is as attractive in real life as the product photography suggested. (Spoiler: the design is brilliant.) I’ve also tested out the iPhone 12 Pro to fully understand the pros and cons of each model. Compare it to the iPhone 11 and you’ll see a huge series of significant upgrades, but if you’re upgrading from an earlier iPhone, you’ll see even more of a difference. Here’s everything you need to know about the iPhone 12, and then some. 
              </p>
              <h3>
                iPhone 12 Design and Display
              </h3>
              <p>
                The iPhone 12 looks strikingly different from its immediate predecessors – everyone will spot you’ve got the new model. That’s down to a flat screen instead of the pillowed display of the iPhone 11. The edges are also flat instead of curved. It’s reminiscent of the iPhone 5 design in some ways, so it’s unmistakably an iPhone. Of course, unlike the iPhone 5, the front is all-screen, with a notch at the top for the True Depth camera.
                The flattened edges, together with noticeably slimmer bezels around the edge of the display, mean that the new iPhone has a smaller footprint than last year’s iPhone 11, 15% less volume, Apple says, though it matches the screen size of 6.1 inches.
                Actually, the screen size remains the same but everything else changes. First, this is an OLED screen, not the LCD technology used on the iPhone 11. This is the first time this high-end screen has been used on an entry-level iPhone. OLED offers brighter colors, inkier black shades and better contrast levels.
              </p>
              <p>And the screen resolution is upgraded, too, from a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch to 460ppi. Put the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 side by side and you can really see the difference. The iPhone 12 has a glass back, ready for wireless charging. It’s shiny but for a matte camera panel in the top-left corner. It’s very eye-catching, though it certainly attracts fingerprints.
                The rest of the back is entirely plain, apart from the centrally placed Apple logo (also there to guide you to the best place to put the iPhone on a wireless charger). More on charging later. The phone has an aluminum frame that’s color-matched to the back of the phone. Even the Lightning charging socket is color-matched inside, a detail you may never see. Only Apple.
              </p>
              <p>The front of the phone uses a much tougher glass than before, which Apple calls Ceramic Shield. It says this is tougher than any other smartphone glass and, to give you a real-world idea of what this means, it has 4x better drop protection. Even so, do try not to drop it, won’t you?
                By the way, many leading phones offer faster refresh rates on their phones, up to 120Hz compared to the standard 60Hz found here. None the less, this screen looks pristine. Scrolling a menu list is smooth enough and video playback looks great.
