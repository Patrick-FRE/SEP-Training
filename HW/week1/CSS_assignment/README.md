# Highlights

1. Layout: Grid
2. [Truncate string with ellipsis](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/truncate-string-with-ellipsis/)
3. The `footer` wraps two `ul`s while screen size shrink: 
    - Two ULs will not overlap: do not use `position: absolute` for the 2rd UL
    - Add `min-width: 300px` for `ul`s & `<footer>` to have properity: `flex-wrap:wrap`
